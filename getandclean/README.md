## Getting and Cleaning Data
(Coursera Assignment)

The run_analysis.R script cleans the accelerometer data set.
It combines the training and test sets, adds 
column headers and inserting a column with the
descriptive activity name.

Produces two tidy data sets: one as described above but
only with mean and std measurement columns; 
The other contains averages of each column grouped by 
subject and activity.
